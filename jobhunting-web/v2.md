ideas for V2:

Custom hooks, will need to look more into this and ask for help. 
Across the board need to fix desktop to mobile view use VH/ VW to set margins


HOME Component:

get rid of labels
lets have it like face book home page
have an input box, you type in stuff and the place holder goes away

lets have a primary light greyish white back ground color
I think have a footer on the home page would be a good start to make things look better
As for info not sure what I want.

Login/Signup component
wouldn't hurt to have a logo or some such thing for our login/sign up pages

Bar graph component:

Need to put info in a visable box sort of like how face book does its login/signup

jobviewall component:

//edit/delete should not be part of the app flow,make it two smaller buttons , or something else that
//is out of the way

//get rid of drop down and buttons
//also change the color state of each card based on what user is chooser
// light green for accepted
// only show buttons when the state is no response.
//    show two buttons accepted or declined by clicking the button it updates that row state.
//      create new state to do this.  Change background color based on state for row

screen sizes:
use a dictinary typescript object to map, component to styles needed, make this a custom
component.


build a reminder component that auto reminds  user of certain things such as getting back in touch with contacts
to also incoming job interviews

dropdown menu needs improvements on styling its ass


for profile instead of headers, lets use images for linked in, git, and the brief case

lets have it that if a job is 7 days old and no response, lets highlight it Yellow, 

for sort maybe make a dict , that calls the function baased on state of action
