ideas for V2:

Custom hooks, will need to look more into this and ask for help. 
Across the board need to fix desktop to mobile view use VH/ VW to set margins


HOME Component:

get rid of labels
lets have it like face book home page
have an input box, you type in stuff and the place holder goes away

lets have a primary light greyish white back ground color
I think have a footer on the home page would be a good start to make things look better
As for info not sure what I want.

Login/Signup component
wouldn't hurt to have a logo or some such thing for our login/sign up pages

Bar graph component:

Need to put info in a visable box sort of like how face book does its login/signup
