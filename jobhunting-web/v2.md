ideas for V2:

Custom hooks, will need to look more into this and ask for help. 
Across the board need to fix desktop to mobile view use VH/ VW to set margins


HOME Component:


lets have a primary light greyish white back ground color
I think have a footer on the home page would be a good start to make things look better
As for info not sure what I want.

Login/Signup component

Bar graph component:

Need to put info in a visable box sort of like how face book does its login/signup

jobviewall component:

//is out of the way

ew state to do this.  Change background color based on state for row

screen sizes:
use a dictinary typescript object to map, component to styles needed, make this a custom
component.


build a reminder component that auto reminds  user of certain things such as getting back in touch with contacts
to also incoming job interviews

dropdown menu needs improvements on styling its ass


for profile instead of headers, lets use images for linked in, git, and the brief case

lets have it that if a job is 7 days old and no response, lets highlight it Yellow, 

for sort maybe make a dict , that calls the function baased on state of action

for v3, I think a modal would be better for our edit page.

I'll also need to update Job model, include "isDelte" colum

need on hoover tool tips, such as when you hoover over an icon it tells you what it does.


 V3:

single letter vars are not allowed, such as "e" for "event" for upcoming refactor lets
spell everything out so its more clear!!!!

i need to change date format, as well as add time to the interviews

in backend might be a goreat idea to filter out older interviews

need interview TIME as well

for description, lets show 20 characters, but also make it clickable just in case

put our filters in ovals, the same way as linkedin
Have something like : Date asc, then once thats clicked we'll change the state to date dsc, no need
for ugly ass buttons




WE ARE AT THE HOME STRETCH HOME SLICE!!!
THE FOLLOWING IS WHAT WE NEED TO COMPLETE

HEADER: 
I WANT ICONS ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE. BELOW EACH ICON LETS HAVE A LABEL


HOME PAGE:
3) MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CENTERED
4) MAKE MOBILE RESPONSIVE, LAPTOP VIEW, MOBILE VIEW, AND DO IN BETWEEN 
5) NEED BETTER EQUAL SPACING BETWEEN SOCIAL LINKS AND FORM

GRAPH PAGE
5) MAKE MOBILE RESPONSIVE, FIX MOBILE VIEW AND SWITCHING BETWEEN THE TWO


NO RESPONSE
6) NEED TO FIX THE WAY DATA IS DISPLAYED ON CARDS NOT SURE ON HOW TO DO THAT THIS
